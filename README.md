<h1>Weather Dashboard</h1>
<br><br>
<h3>Description</h3>
This is a challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. We were required to use the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities and use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.
<br><br>
<h3>Task</h3>
As a traveler I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly.
<ul>
  <li>When I search for a city I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.</li>
  <li>When I view current weather conditions for that city I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
  </li>
  <li>When I view the UV index, I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.</li>
  <li>When I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
  </li>
  <li>When I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
  </li>
</ul>
